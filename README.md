If Monet, Picasso, or Van Gogh lived another 100 years, what would they have painted? In order to do answer this, I train a GAN to generate art, and  find image codes for the artist's paintings over many years of their career. Using a linear regression, I find trends in these image codes over time. Finally, by extrapolating out these trends, I am able to predict what their future paintings would have looked like.
