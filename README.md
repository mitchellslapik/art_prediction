If Monet, Picasso, Van Gogh lived another 100 years, what would they have painted? In order to do answer this, I train a GAN on art, and then find the corresponding image codes for the artist's paintings over many years of their career. Using a linear regression, I find trends in these image codes over time. Finally, by extrapolating out these trends, I am able to predict what their future paintings would look like.
